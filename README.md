# Java Verlet Integration Physics Simulation
A physics simulation with a few components including simulated nodes, constraints for nodes which allow for cloth or polygon simulation, and simple box and circle colliders for nodes which can be combined to create more complex shapes. The physics simulation can be used to create simple games (for example breakout, a basketball game, or a pinball machine).
